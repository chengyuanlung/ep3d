# Architecture Decision Log

## ADR-001 — Modern C++ Core
Status: Accepted

Use C++20 for the new CAD core. Legacy application code may remain in its existing toolchain, but this project does not target legacy compilers.

## ADR-002 — Core independent of UI and CAD kernel
Status: Accepted

`src/Core` may not depend on Qt or OpenCASCADE. Adapters isolate external frameworks.

## ADR-003 — Part physical properties are first-class
Status: Accepted

Material assignment and derived Mass/COM/Inertia are included from the initial Part data model to support future mechanism, robot, and physics workflows.

## ADR-004 — Motion belongs to Assembly joints
Status: Accepted

A Part can expose Connectors/Frames, but revolute/prismatic behavior is established by Assembly-level Joints.

## ADR-005 — ReferenceFrame is general infrastructure
Status: Accepted

User/Tool/Camera/Fixture/Robot frames use one common frame graph rather than robot-specific coordinate classes.

## ADR-006 — Collision is separate from Joint limits
Status: Accepted

Joint limits constrain allowed generalized coordinates; collision checks whether spatial configurations are valid.

## ADR-007 — DependencyGraph semantics
Status: Accepted

The Core `DependencyGraph` (M1) is a standalone DAG over `ObjectId` nodes; document integration is deferred to M2/M3.

- Edges point prerequisite → dependent; `addDependency(dependent, prerequisite)` reads "dependent consumes prerequisite". Cycles are rejected with a structured error and leave the graph unchanged.
- `markDirty` propagates transitively downstream, passing through Suppressed nodes without changing their state.
- Actual edge insertion/removal marks the dependent Dirty (transitively); duplicate/absent-edge no-op paths dirty nothing.
- Recompute is topological, deterministic (insertion-order tie-breaking, per-session only), and visits only Dirty nodes, each at most once.
- A Failed node persists as a downstream barrier across recompute passes: a Dirty dependent of a Failed prerequisite is set Failed without invoking its callback, until the failed node is re-marked Dirty and recomputes successfully. Idle passes do not re-report long-standing failures.
- `ComputeState` is shared with `Feature` via `Core/Feature/ComputeState.h` (single enum, no drift).

## ADR-008 — Known discrepancy: GoogleTest not yet wired
Status: Open

Roadmap M0 lists "GoogleTest enabled", but the repository has no GTest dependency; tests are plain `assert` + `main` executables registered with CTest. Consequence: mutating calls inside `assert(...)` make a Release-config test run vacuous — Debug ctest is the authoritative run. Adopt GoogleTest or an always-on CHECK macro before the M2 kernel work grows the suite.
